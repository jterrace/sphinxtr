.. epigraph::

   *Your avatar can look any way you want it to, up to the limitations of your equipment. If you're ugly, you can make your avatar beautiful. If you've just gotten out of bed, your avatar can be wearing beautiful clothes and professionally applied makeup. You can look like a gorilla or a dragon, or a giant talking penis in the Metaverse. Spend five minutes walking down the street, and you will see all of these.*
